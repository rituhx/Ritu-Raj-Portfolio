# Hrithik's Portfolio

A simple multi-page portfolio with 5 sections.

## Pages

1. **Intro** (`index.html`) – Your intro, photo, and resume download button  
2. **About** (`about.html`) – About you  
3. **Projects** (`projects.html`) – Featured projects  
4. **Skills** (`skills.html`) – Technical skills  
5. **Contact** (`contact.html`) – Work together / contact

## Setup

1. **Profile photo**  
   Add your photo as `images/profile.jpg` (square works best).

2. **Resume**  
   Place your resume PDF in the project root as `resume.pdf`. The "Download Resume" button on the Intro page will use it.

3. **Content**  
   Edit each HTML file to add your real text, project links, email, LinkedIn, and GitHub URLs.

## Run locally

Open `index.html` in a browser, or use a simple server:

```bash
npx serve .
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000`.

FEATURED PROJECTS

A9G-Based SOS Button GPS Tracker
Developed a cost-effective, low-power emergency alert device using ESP32 and A9G GSM/GPRS/GPS module. The system sends real-time GPS location to the cloud via MQTT when the SOS button is pressed, enabling rapid response in critical situations. Designed with FreeRTOS for efficient multitasking and integrated cloud management for scalable deployment.

Real-Time Human Motion Classification Using Edge Impulse and IMU Sensors
Designed a lightweight, on-device machine learning system to classify human activities such as walking, running, and sitting using IMU sensor data. Optimized for real-time performance and low power consumption, making it suitable for wearables, fitness, and health monitoring applications.

Sign Language Detection System
Designed and implemented a machine learning-based solution capable of recognizing sign language gestures in real time. The system converts hand movements into readable text, improving accessibility and enabling inclusive communication through smart applications.

LET’S WORK TOGETHER

I am open to internships, entry-level roles, freelance opportunities, and technical collaborations. If you have a project in mind or would like to connect, I’d be happy to hear from you.
