# Hrithik's Portfolio

A simple multi-page portfolio with 5 sections.

## Pages

1. **Intro** (`index.html`) – Your intro, photo, and resume download button  
2. **About** (`about.html`) – About you  
3. **Projects** (`projects.html`) – Featured projects  
4. **Skills** (`skills.html`) – Technical skills  
5. **Contact** (`contact.html`) – Work together / contact

## Setup

1. **Profile photo**  
   Add your photo as `images/profile.jpg` (square works best).

2. **Resume**  
   Place your resume PDF in the project root as `resume.pdf`. The "Download Resume" button on the Intro page will use it.

3. **Content**  
   Edit each HTML file to add your real text, project links, email, LinkedIn, and GitHub URLs.

## Run locally

Open `index.html` in a browser, or use a simple server:

```bash
npx serve .
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000`.
